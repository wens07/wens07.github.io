### Proof of stake algorithm
- chain-based proof of stake
   like DPOS, DPOC (using coin age to distinguish the period of holding the coins)

   > using a certain random algorithm to select participants with the highest stakes as validator, assuming the highest stakeholders are incentivized to ensure a transaction is processed. ***the idea is that those with the most coins in criculation have the most to lose so they are positioned to work in the interest of the network. the amount of coins that a network may require changes just like the difficulty in POW*

   > the common argument against proof-of-stake is the Nothing at Stake Problem. the conern is that since it costs validators almost no computational power to support a fork unlike PoW, validators can vote for both sides of every fork that happens.

   > ***Nothing at stake problem***: you lose anything from behaving badly, so your incentive is to sign everywhere because it doesn't cost you anything.

- BFT based proof of stake
